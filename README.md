# Blust.AI Developer Manifesto
## The Era of Fair Open-Source

At Blust.AI, we're pioneering a new era where open-source doesn't equate to unpaid work. We believe in **fair compensation for developers** and are on a mission to create the ultimate AI marketplace. Imagine a platform where your AI tools not only gain visibility but also generate income from day one. Think of us as the _YouTube for AI creators_, where your creations are showcased to users who need them, and you're paid for every use.

### Why Join Blust.AI?  
  
We're committed to offering developers like you six lucrative ways to earn, all while contributing to a fair and open-source ecosystem:

1. **Innovate with AI Tools:** Use fast-prototyping tools for _React_ or even no-code solutions to create new AI tools for Blust.AI. We're looking for tools similar to customGPTs but with more features and better UIs.
2. **Custom Actions for GPTs:** Develop custom actions for customGPTs and their future analogues. Your _API_ or _lambda functions_ will empower no-code AI creators to build more dynamic applications.
3. **Integrate with OAUTH-2:** Connect your existing AI tools to our platform using the _OAUTH-2_ protocol, making them accessible to a wider audience.
4. **List Custom Models:** Bring your fine-tuned or custom-trained models to our platform, offering users specialized capabilities that aren't found anywhere else.
5. **Consulting Opportunities:** Share your expertise by consulting our _B2B clients_, providing guidance and innovative solutions to real-world problems.
6. **Affiliate Program:** Earn by promoting Blust.AI, bringing more creators and users into our growing ecosystem.

### Our Promise to You    
Blust.AI aims to be a beacon of fairness in the open-source community. Your contributions will not only enhance our platform but will also be fairly compensated based on usage. This is your chance to be part of a community that values your work and ensures it pays off.
